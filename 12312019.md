### Web Development Journey

#### HTML
1. `<kbd>` Tag - from MDN
> The HTML Keyboard Input element represents a span of inline text denoting textual user input from a keyboard, voice input, or any other text entry device. By convention, the user agent defaults to rendering the contents of a `<kbd>` element using its default monospace font, although this is not mandated by the HTML standard.
 - *Use: * Not used outside of javascript30 project

2. `<audio>` Tag - New in HTML5 and used to embed one or more audio sources represented by `<src>` or `<source>` tag.
 - *Use:* Used the `currentTime` attribute in the (https://github.com/dpillai/javascript30/tree/master/JSDrumKit) project. Setting it 0 (i.e.  setting back to the start) with every key press allowed for sounding off when the key was pressed in in quick succession. Otherwise, depending on the length of the audio; each key press would not have made a sound.

#### javascript
1. `JSON.parse()` and `JSON.stringify()` - Used  to conversion between JS objects and JSON strings
  - *Use:* Used it in > My Workout Log to `getItem()` and `setItem()` into the `localStorage`. e.g:
  `JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('exercises'))`
  `localStorage.setItem('exercises', JSON.stringify(exercises)`
2. `localStorage` - see above for use.
3. `addEventListener()`- to listen to events such as `keydown` and `transitionend` events.
 - *Use:*
 `window.addEventListener('keydown', playSound)` led to `function playSound(e)`
 - *Follow up* - Need to understand more about Target (window vs document vs appropriate)
 4. `InnerHTML` - Creating new `HTML` elements dynamically.
