### Web Development Journey

#### HTML
1. `<kbd>` Tag - from MDN
> The HTML Keyboard Input element represents a span of inline text denoting textual user input from a keyboard, voice input, or any other text entry device. By convention, the user agent defaults to rendering the contents of a `<kbd>` element using its default monospace font, although this is not mandated by the HTML standard.
 - *Use: * Not used outside of javascript30 project

2. `<audio>` Tag - New in HTML5 and used to embed one or more audio sources represented by `<src>` or `<source>` tag.
 - *Use:* Used the `currentTime` attribute in the (https://github.com/dpillai/javascript30/tree/master/JSDrumKit) project. Setting it 0 (i.e.  setting back to the start) with every key press allowed for sounding off when the key was pressed in in quick succession. Otherwise, depending on the length of the audio; each key press would not have made a sound.

#### JavaScript
1. `JSON.parse()` and `JSON.stringify()` - Used  to conversion between JS objects and JSON strings
  - *Use:* Used it in > My Workout Log to `getItem()` and `setItem()` into the `localStorage`. e.g:
  `JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('exercises'))`
  `localStorage.setItem('exercises', JSON.stringify(exercises)`
2. `localStorage` - see above for use.
3. `addEventListener()`- to listen to events such as `keydown` and `transitionend` events.
 - *Use:*
 `window.addEventListener('keydown', playSound)` led to `function playSound(e)`
 - *Follow up* - Need to understand more about Target (window vs document vs appropriate)
 4. `InnerHTML` - Creating new `HTML` elements dynamically.

#### JavaScript - [Modern JavaScript Tutorial]
(https://javascript.info)
1. What can JavaScript do?
 - Add `html`to the page
 - React to user actions
 - Send requests over the network
 - Get and set cookies
 - Remember data on the client side (localStorage)

2. What can Javascript not do?
 - Cannot read/write arbitrary files on the hard disk
 - No access OS system functions
 - Different tabs/windows *generally* do not know about each other
 - Safety limitation on its ability to retrieve data from other sites/domains besides the server where the current page came from.

3. We can use a `<script>` tag to add JavaScript code to a page.
 - The `type` and `language` attributes are not required.
 - A script in an external file can be inserted with `<script src="path/to/script.js"></script>`.

4. In most cases, a newline implies a semicolon. But “in most cases” does not mean “always”

5. `//` or `/*...*/` for single and multi-line comments.

6. The "use strict" directive switches the engine to the “modern” mode, changing the behavior of some built-in features.
 - Strict mode is enabled by placing "use strict" at the top of a script or function.
 - Several language features, like “classes” and “modules”, enable strict mode automatically.
 - Strict mode is supported by all modern browsers.
 - We recommended always starting scripts with "use strict".

7. We can declare variables to store data by using the `var`, `let`, or `const` keywords.
 - `let` – is a modern variable declaration.
 - `const` – is like let, but the value of the variable can’t be changed.
 - variable names can have numbers, character and `_`, `$` symbols. Cannot start with numbers

8. There are 8 basic data types in JavaScript.

 - number for numbers of any kind: integer or floating-point, integers are limited by ±253.
 - bigint is for integer numbers of arbitrary length.
 - string for strings. A string may have one or more characters, there’s no separate single-character type.
 - boolean for true/false.
 - null for unknown values – a standalone type that has a single value null.
 - undefined for unassigned values – a standalone type that has a single value undefined.
 - object for more complex data structures.
 - symbol for unique identifiers.
 - The typeof operator allows us to see which type is stored in a variable. Two forms: typeof x or typeof(x). Returns a string with the name of the type, like "string".
    - For null returns "object" – this is an error in the language, it’s not actually an object.

9. Type conversion - Most common ones are string, number and boolean
 - String Conversion – Occurs when we output something. Can be performed with `String(value)`.
 - Numeric Conversion – Occurs in math operations. Can be performed with `Number(value)`. The conversion follows the rules:
    - `undefined` becomes `NaN`
    - `null` becomes 0
    - `true` or `false` becomes 1 or 0
    - string - The string is read “as is”, whitespaces from both sides are ignored. An empty string becomes 0. An error gives NaN.
 - Boolean Conversion – Occurs in logical operations. Can be performed with `Boolean(value)`.The conversion follows the rules:
  - 0, `null`, `undefined`, `NaN`, ""	becomes `false` any other value	true
