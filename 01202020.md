Basics on Objects
1. Objects are associative arrays with several special features.
2. They store properties (key-value pairs), where:
  - Property keys must be strings or symbols (usually strings).
  - Values can be of any type.
3. To access a property, we can use:
  - The dot notation: `obj.property`.
  - Square brackets notation `obj["property"]`. Square brackets allow to take the key from a variable, like obj[varWithKey].
4. Additional operators:
  - To delete a property: `delete obj.prop`.
  - To check if a property with the given key exists: `"key" in obj`.
  - To iterate over an object: `for (let key in obj)` loop.
5. Objects are assigned and copied by reference. In other words, a variable stores not the “object value”, but a “reference” (address in memory) for the value. So copying such a variable or passing it as a function argument copies that reference, not the object. All operations via copied references (like adding/removing properties) are performed on the same single object.
6. To make a “real copy” (a clone) we can use `Object.assign` or `_.cloneDeep(obj)`.
