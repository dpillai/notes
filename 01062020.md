### Web Development Journey

#### HTML
1. `for` attribute for `<label>` tag specifies the form element the label is bound to

####JavaScript [Modern JavaScript]
1. Conditional Operators
   - __`if`__ - The if (…) statement evaluates the expression in its parentheses and converts the result to a boolean.
    - A number 0, an empty string "", null, undefined, and NaN all become false. Because of that they are called “falsy” values.
    - Other values become true, so they are called “truthy”.
  - `else if` and `else` are optional classes
  - `?` Sometimes it’s called “ternary”, because the operator has three operands. It is actually the one and only operator in JavaScript which has that many.
2. Logical Operators
  - `||` __(OR)__
    - OR operator finds the 1st truthy value
    - Can be used to get the 1st truthy value from a list of expressions.
  - `&&` __(AND)__
   - AND operator finds the first falsy value
   - The precedence of AND && operator is higher than OR ||.
  - `!` __(NOT)__
   - The operator accepts a single argument and does the following:
    - Converts the operand to boolean type: true/false.
    - Returns the inverse value.

3. Loops
  - `while` – The condition is checked before each iteration.
  - `do..while` – The condition is checked after each iteration.
  - `for (;;)` – The condition is checked before each iteration, additional settings available.
 - To make an “infinite” loop, usually the while(true) construct is used. Such a loop, just like any other, can be stopped with the break directive.
 - If we don’t want to do anything in the current iteration and would like to forward to the next one, we can use the `continue` directive.
 - `break/continue` support labels before the loop. A __label__ is the __only way__ for break/continue __to escape__ a nested loop to go to an outer one.
 - ```
 switch(x) {
  case 'value1':  // if (x === 'value1')
  //steps
    [break]
  case 'value2':  // if (x === 'value2')
    //steps
    [break]
  default:
    //steps
    [break]
}
```
4. functions
  - Syntax:
   `function name(parameter) {}`
  - A variable declared inside a function is only visible inside that function.
  - A function can access an outer variable as well
  - The outer variable is only used if there’s no local one.
  - Global variables - variables defined outside of any function_name
  - Default values - If a parameter is not provided, then its value becomes `undefined`.
