### Web Development Journey

#### css [from javscript 30]
Huge learning curve today. Got introduced to the following properties

1. `box-shadow` property used to attach one or more shadows to the elements
 - Syntax :
 ```
 box-shadow: none|h-offset v-offset blur spread color |inset|initial|inherit;
 ```
 - Example :
 ```
 box-shadow: 20px 20px 50px 10px pink inset;    
```
2. `Transform` property applies a 2D or 3D transformation to an element. This property allows you to rotate, scale, move, skew, etc., elements.
  - `rotate(XXdeg)` - rotates the element by the angle specified.
  - `scale(x,y)` - scales the element by ratio specified.
3. `transform-origin` -  moves the origin of rotation along x-axis
So a 100% transform-origin would shift the origin to the rightmost end of the element (in our case, hand).



#### Javascript [from javascript30]
1. __Date__ class
  - Learnt the following methods on `Date`:
    - `Date()` - constructor for `Date` class
    - `GetSeconds()`, `getMinutes()` and `getHours()` methods for current date.
2. To able to call on a function at set intervals using the `setInterval(function_name, milliseconds)` function. Went on to use to it to get the seconds, minutes and hours to be fed into `transform: rotate(XXdeg)` attribute.
Add and remove classes to element objects with `element.classList.add(class-name)` and `element.classList.remove(class-name)`.
