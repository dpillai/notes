#### Javascript
1. Hoisiting
  - JS's default behavior of moving declarations to the top
  - Initializations are not moved to the top
  - JavaScript in strict mode does not allow variables to be used if they are not declared.
  - Variables declared with `let` or `const` are not hoisted up
2. Scope
  - In JavaScript there are two types of scope:
    Local scope
    Global scope
  - JavaScript has function scope: Each function creates a new scope.
  - Scope determines the accessibility (visibility) of these variables.
  - Variables defined inside a function are not accessible (visible) from outside the function.
  - If you assign a value to a variable that has not been declared, it will automatically become a GLOBAL variable.
  - In "Strict Mode", undeclared variables are not automatically global.
