### Web Development Journey

#### git
1. To connect __existing__ local repository to remote
  - Create remote repository on github
  ```
  git remote add origin https://github.com/dpillai/conFusion.git
  git push -u origin master
  ```

#### Pixels
1. Stands for picture element, the smallest addressable element.
2. They are used as a unit of measure as in 2400 pixels per inch of otherwise __ppi__.
3. Dots per inch (__dpi__) is distinct from ppi.
4. There is a difference between __CSS pixels__ vs __device pixels__. Devs should usually care about CSS pixels.
  - __At zoom level 100% one CSS pixel is exactly equal to one device pixel.__
  - User zooming in/out is about scaling the CSS pixels in relation to device pixels. If the user zooms in 1 CSS pixel will overlap more than one device pixels.

#### HTML/CSS/JavaScript
1. Viewports [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/viewport]
  - A viewport represents a polygonal (normally rectangular) area in computer graphics that is currently being viewed. In web browser terms, it refers to the part of the document you're viewing which is currently visible in its window (or the screen, if the document is being viewed in full screen mode). Content outside the viewport is not visible onscreen until scrolled into view.
  - The portion of the viewport that is currently visible is called the __visual viewport__. This can be smaller than the __layout viewport__, such as when the user has pinched-zoomed. The layout viewport remains the same, but the visual viewport became smaller.
  - The layout viewport can be found in `document.documentElement.clientWidth` and `-Height`.
  - There’s a formal difference between the two property pairs: `document.documentElement.clientWidth` and `-Height` doesn’t include the scrollbar, while `window.innerWidth/Height` does.
2. For __Media queries__ we should `width/height` and not `device-width/height` <--__haven't completely grasped this yet__
